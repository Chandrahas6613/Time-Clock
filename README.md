# Time-Clock

_Designed an informative system of an online clock. This application can be found in smart phones, laptops, personal computers and other electronic devices for knowing the time. This feature is in-built in many electronic devices. Based on the other IP address of the system, the clock displays the time. It consists of three hands, the fastest one for seconds, the longest one for minutes, and comparatively the shortest one for hours.  Our digital clock would simply be unable to display the time elapsed without these variables and the calculations we conduct with them. We can implement it using JavaScript. It is a simple DOM (Document Object Model) know the time JavaScript Project._

**_I hereby conclude my system will be a great informative one, which is designed using a JavaScript._**
